## About Me

I am known by the username **Carghty** on Discord and other communities. I enjoy programming; since I was young, it has been my dream to learn more about this world. Since I was 12 years old, I have been learning regularly, starting with the basics: JavaScript and HTML. You can see the languages I am most proficient in right here in my Bio. If you need help with anything, don't hesitate to ask me! I know that my help can help others, just as people have helped me before.
